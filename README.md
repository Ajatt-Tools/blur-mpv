This is specially helpful when running old media from 2000s or older

## Installation

The installation process is no different from other mpv scripts.

Install in one line:

```
$ git clone 'https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/blur-mpv.git' ~/.config/mpv/scripts/blur_mpv
```

Or manually download the folder and save it to `~/.config/mpv/scripts/`.
The location may differ depending on the operating system or if you use a custom fork of mpv.
